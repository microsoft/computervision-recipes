## Scenarios

Most applications in computer vision (CV) fall into one of these 4 categories:

- **Image classification**: Given an input image, predict what object is present in the image. This is typically the easiest CV problem to solve, however classification requires objects to be reasonably large in the image.

- **Object Detection**: Given an input image, identify and locate which objects are present (using rectangular coordinates). Object detection can find small objects in an image. Compared to image classification, both model training and manually annotating images is more time-consuming in object detection, since both the label and location are required.

- **Image Similarity** Given an input image, find all similar objects in images from a reference dataset. Here, rather than predicting a label and/or rectangle, the task is to sort through a reference dataset to find objects similar to that found in the query image.

- **Image Segmentation** Given an input image, assign a label to every pixel (e.g., background, bottle, hand, sky, etc.). In practice, this problem is less common in industry, in large part due to time required to label the ground truth segmentation required in order to train a solution.

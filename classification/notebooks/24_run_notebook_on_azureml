    "# Submit an Existing Notebook to AzureML\n",
    "In this noteboook we provide a scaffold to directly submit an existing notebook to the AzureML compute targets. Now we don't need to rewrite the training script, instead, we can now take the same notebook we ran on our local machine (01_training_introduction.ipynb), send it to the AzureML platform, and have it run over there. \n",
    "        In a couple of minutes, this process generates a copy of our notebook with the results of each cell, that we can download on our machine. This is convenient especially when the computations we want to execute require a lot of memory or even GPUs.\n",

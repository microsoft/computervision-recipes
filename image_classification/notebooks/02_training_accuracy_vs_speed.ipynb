    "# Building Models for Accuracy VS Speed\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to understand how to train a model with different parameters to achieve either a highly accurate but slow model, or a model with fast inference speed but with lower accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "As practitioners of computer vision, we want to be able to control what to optimize when building our models. Unless you are building a model for a Kaggle competition, it is unlikely that you can build your model with only its accuracy in mind. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in an IoT setting, where the inferencing device has limited computational capabilities, we need to design our models to have a small memory footprint. In contrast, medical situations often require the highest possible accuracy because the cost of mis-classification could impact the well-being of a patient. In this scenario, the accuracy of the model can not be compromised. \n",
    "\n",
    "We have conducted various experiments on multiple diverse datasets to find parameters which work well on a wide variety of settings, for e.g. high accuracy or fast inference. In this notebook, we provide these parameters, so that your initial models can be trained without any parameter tuning. For most datasets, these parameters are close to optimal, so there won't need to change them much. In the second part of the notebook, we will give guidelines as to what parameters could be fine-tuned and how they impact the model, and which parameters typically do not have a big influence\n",
    "\n",
    "It is recommended that you first train your model with the default parameters, evaluate the results, and then only as needed, try fine tuning parameters to achieve better results."

    "If you use the parameters provided in the repo along with the defaults that Fastai provides, you can get good results across a wide variety of datasets. However, as is true for most machine learning projects, getting the best possible results for a new dataset requires tuning the parameters that you use. The following section provides guidelines on how to optimize for accuracy, inference speed, or model size on a given dataset. We'll go through the parameters that will make the largest impact on your model as well as the parameters that may not be worth tweaking.\n",

    "Generally speaking, models for image classification comes with a trade-off between training time versus model accuracy. The four parameters that most affect this trade-off are the DNN architecture, image resolution, learning rate, and number of epochs. DNN architecture and image resolution will additionally affect the model's inference time and memory footprint. As a rule of thumb, deeper networks with high image resolution will achieve higher accuracy at the cost of large model sizes and low training and inference speeds. Shallow networks with low image resolution will result in models with fast inference speed, fast training speeds and low model sizes at the cost of the model's accuracy. "

    "__Learning rate__ \n",
    "\n",
    "Learning rate step size is used when optimizing your model with gradient descent and tends to be one of the most important parameters to set when training your model. If your learning rate is set too low, training will progress very slowly since we're only making tiny updates to the weights in your network. However, if your learning rate is too high, it can cause undesirable divergent behavior in your loss function. Generally speaking, choosing a learning rate of 1e-4 was shown to work pretty well for most datasets. If you want to reduce training time (by training for fewer epochs), you can try setting the learning rate to 5e-3, but if you notice a spike in the training or validation loss, you may want to try reducing your learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can learn more about learning rate in the [appendix below](#appendix-learning-rate).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Epochs__\n",
    "\n",
    "When it comes to choosing the number of epochs, a common question is - _Won't too many epochs will cause overfitting_? It turns out that the accuracy on the test set typically does not get worse, even if training for too many epochs. Unless your are working with small datasets, using around 15 epochs tends to work pretty well in most cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Batch Size__\n",
    "\n",
    "Batch size is the number of training samples you use in order to make one update to the model parameters. A batch size of 16 or 32 works well for most cases. The higher the batch size, the faster training will be, but at the expense of an increased DNN memory consumption. Depending on your dataset and the GPU you have, you can start with a batch size of 32, and move down to 16 if your GPU doesn't have enough memory. After a certain increase in batch size, improvments to training speed become marginal, hence we found 16 (or 32) to be a good trade-off between training speed and memory consumption.If you reduce the batch size, you may also have to reduce the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Image size__ \n",
    "\n",
    "The default image size is __300 X 300__ pixels. Using higher image resolution of, for example, __500 X 500__ or even higher, can improve the accuracy of the model but at the cost of longer training and inference times.\n",

In Fastai, dropout is by default set to 0.5 on the final layer, and 0.25 on all previous layer. Unless there is clear evidence of over-fitting, drop out tends to work well at this default so there is no need to change it much.\n",

    "__Weight decay (L2 regularization)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Weight decay is a regularization term applied when minimizing the network's loss. We can think of it as a penalty applied to the weights after an update.

    "Momentum is a way to reach convergence faster when training our model. It is a way to incorporate a weighted average of the most recent updates to the current update. Fastai implements cyclical momentum when calling `fit_one_cycle()`, so the momentum will fluctuate over the course of the training cycle, hence we need a min and max value for momentum. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using `fit_one_cycle()`, the default value of max=0.95 and min=0.85 is shown to work well. If using `fit()`, the default value of 0.9 has been shown to work well.

But this may not be the case for every dataset. If you look carefully, there is a pretty significant variance between the datasets and it may be possible that a learning rate of 1-e3 works better than a learning rate of 1e-4 for some datasets. In the figure on the right, both 1e-4 and 1e-3 seem to work well. At 15 epochs, the results of 1e-4 are only slightly better than that of 1e-3. However, at 3 epochs, a learning rate of 1e-3 out performs the learning rate at 1e-4. This makes sense since we're limiting the training to only 3 epochs, the model that can update its weights more quickly will perform better. As a result, we may learn towards using higher learning rates (such as 1e-3) if we want to minimize the training time, and lower learning rates (such as 1e-4) if training time is not constrained. \n",

Generally speaking, choosing a learning rate of 5e-3 (the mean of 1e-3 and 1e-4) was shown to work pretty well for most datasets. However, for some datasets, a learning rate of 5-e3 will cause the training to diverge. In those cases, try a lower epoch, like 1e-4. \n",
